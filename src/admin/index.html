# Youth for Climate

**Fighting Food Waste & Climate Change â€” Together.**

We are a youth-led campaign on a mission to raise awareness and drive community action around two urgent global issues: **climate change** and **food waste**.

ðŸŒ± **Why It Matters:**  
Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted â€” contributing to methane emissions, deforestation, and climate imbalance. Small changes in our daily habits can lead to big collective impact.

ðŸ™Œ **What We Do:**  
- Host workshops and community events  
- Share real stories from the youth  
- Provide tips for sustainable living  
- Mobilize local action teams
